## SupplyCentral
`SupplyCentral` is a desktop app for business owners to manage their suppliers and goods.

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, `SupplyCentral` can get your supplier and goods management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Example Usage
- Maintain a of list of suppliers and their contact information
- Keep track of the goods that you have ordered from each supplier

### Codebase and Documentation
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** 
* (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SupplyCentral Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103-f10-1.github.io/tp/)**.

### Acknowledgements
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
