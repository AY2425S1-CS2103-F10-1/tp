**SupplyCentral is a desktop application for managing supplier contacts**, optimized for use via 
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, 
SupplyCentral can get your supplier management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using SupplyCentral, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing SupplyCentral, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
